//    Create a
//    Car enum class with FERRARI, PORSCHE, MERCEDES, BMW, OPEL, FIAT, TOYOTA etc. constants.
//    Each vehicle has its own parameters, e.g. price, power, etc. Enum should contain boolean isPremium() and
//    boolean isRegular() methods. The isPremium() method should return the opposite result to the call of the
//    isRegular() method.
//    In addition, the
//    boolean isFasterThan() method should be declared and implemented as part of the enum
//    class. This method should accept the Car type object and display information that the indicated vehicle is
//    faster or not than the vehicle provided in the argument. To do this, use the compareTo() method.
